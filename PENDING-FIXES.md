# Pending Fixes for quality-tools Self-Analysis

## High Priority (CRAP Score > 30)

### 1. Refactor `count_potential_mutations` (CRAP 8742)
- **File:** crates/mutation-test/src/main.rs:198
- **Issue:** Large match statement with repeated patterns
- **Attempted:** Multiple edit attempts, Python scripts for replacement
- **Status:** Stuck - edit tool can't match the complex function correctly
- **Target:** Reduce CRAP score to < 30
- **Approach:** Create helper function `count_ops(source: &str, ops: &[&str]) -> usize`
- **Note:** Partial refactoring showed CRAP can be reduced to 132 (from 8742)

### 2. Refactor `analyze_non_rust_file` (CRAP 1806)
- **File:** crates/mutation-test/src/main.rs:103
- **Issue:** Complex control flow for language detection
- **Target:** Reduce CRAP score to < 30

### 3. Refactor `run` function (CRAP 930)
- **File:** crates/mutation-test/src/main.rs:316
- **Issue:** Large function with many responsibilities
- **Target:** Reduce CRAP score to < 30

## Medium Priority

### 4. Address Code Duplication
- **Location:** ast-parse-ts/src/lib.rs
- **Issue:** Duplicate patterns across language parsers
- **Approach:** Create shared helper functions for common patterns

### 5. Add Documentation to Remaining Functions
- `parse_fingerprints` - DONE
- `sarif_run` - DONE  
- `get_rule_details` - DONE
- Check for other undocumented public functions

## Completed (Commited)

✅ Fix taint violations in taint-scan (moved fixtures to external files)
✅ Add documentation to parse_fingerprints, sarif_run, get_rule_details
✅ Add NDJSON support to debt, doccov, dupfind, coupling, riskmap
✅ Add suggested_fix, auto_fix_available fields to all tool outputs
✅ Add confidence field to heuristic tools (fuzz, taint)
✅ Create JSON schemas for all tool outputs

## Build Status

- Project builds successfully (with some warnings)
- serde_json macro errors are unrelated to our changes
- Some fuzz-surface and taint-scan warnings about dead code (expected)

## Next Steps

1. Refactor `count_potential_mutations` using a different approach:
   - Write new function to a separate file
   - Use `mod` to include it
   - Or manually edit with extreme care
   
2. Continue with other high CRAP score functions
3. Address code duplication
4. Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to fix style issues
